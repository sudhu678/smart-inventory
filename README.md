The scanned images will be classified using Vision AI powered by Google's Gemini Pro Vision model. This makes inventory system smart with ability to keep track of misplaced products. Automatic task will be created when product/item is misplaced by employee or customer. Now employees will have better visibility of all misplaced products and can take quick actions at their convenience. The online order fulfillment can also be done quickly since system knows real time position of misplaced products that is very crucial especially when stock is limited.

The stores commonly re-shuffle their products to get customer attractions and boost their sales. The system keep track of hot spots and provides ability to plan product re-shuffling by product stock, expiry, and least viewed products. The plan creates automatic tasks for employees to execute.
